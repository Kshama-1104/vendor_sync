## Performance Metrics

### Flow Execution Metrics
- Execution time per flow
- Execution time per state
- Action execution time
- Total flow duration

### Throughput Metrics
- Flows executed per second
- States processed per second
- Actions executed per second
- Events processed per second

### Latency Metrics
- State transition latency
